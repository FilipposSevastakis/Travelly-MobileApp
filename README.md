# Travelly-MobileApp
Mobile App development: Term project for the course 'Human-Computer Interaction, ECE NTUA, 2022/23

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
This project was carried out for the course of "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)" at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. The objective of this project was to develop a mobile app, with emphasis on the use of HCI elements.

## ðŸ“„ Description:
"Travelly" is an app that allows users to pinpoint (visited) locations on a world map, including/storing a title and images (either from the Gallery or by taking one on the spot) on each pin. Furthermore, each user has a profile that showcases his username, a profile description, optionally a profile image and his "collection" of visited countries in the form of their flags, as well as the percentage of the world visited. A chat is also implemented, for friends to be able to communicate with each other and, primarily, to exchange photos from their common trips. Lastly, one can find their current location for a quick-pin of that location, as well as use voice commands in the chat section, that recognise the title of a pin and displays all it's stored photos to choose from and send to others.

Regarding the HCI elements, the app implements Gamification, Haptics, Camera and Audio, as well as GPS and Wi-Fi/Data (connectivity-wise).

## Application Design:
As the first step of this project it was essential to design a (functional) prototype. To this end, we used a design and prototyping tool, Figma.

## Setup:
To be added
